## 🔎 About
In the last year, I’ve built **20+ end-to-end labs** without a mentor or internship—purely from disciplined study and execution.  
I focus on **cloud attack simulations, log pipelines, detection rules, dashboards, IR runbooks, and serverless automation**.

**Highlights**
- 20+ projects across **SOC, Cloud Sec, IR, Malware, Automation**
- Tooling: **Splunk, Zeek, Suricata, Cowrie, Wireshark, Ghidra, Terraform, Boto3**
- Clouds: **AWS** and **GCP**
- Outcome: **Detections that actually fire** + **automations that actually fix**

## 🧭 How I Work (Methodology)
**Simulate** realistic threats → **Collect** telemetry (CloudTrail, IDS, endpoint, auth) →  
**Detect** with SIEM queries & rules → **Respond** with playbooks & IR docs →  
**Automate** guardrails & remediation (Lambda, Terraform, Boto3).
