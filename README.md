## Methodology
My approach follows a structured workflow:  
1. **Simulate**: Emulate realistic threats to mimic attacker TTPs.  
2. **Collect**: Gather telemetry from CloudTrail, IDS, endpoints, and authentication logs.  
3. **Detect**: Build SIEM queries and rules for reliable threat detection.  
4. **Respond**: Develop playbooks and incident response documentation.  
5. **Automate**: Implement guardrails and remediation using Lambda, Terraform, and Boto3.  

*Example*: In my AWS SOC Simulation, I detected an IAM privilege escalation attempt within 10 minutes using Splunk queries, automated containment with Lambda, and documented a repeatable playbook for future incidents.
